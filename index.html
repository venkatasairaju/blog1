    <h2> The problems with AI in the workplace?</h2>
    <p> The risks of AI for workers are greater if it undermines workers' rights, embeds bias and discrimination in decision-making processes, or makes consequential workplace decisions without transparency, human oversight, and review. There are also risks that workers will be displaced entirely from their jobs by AI.</p>
     
    <h2>History of AI and Birth of AI : 1950-1956</h2>
    <p>The field of artificial intelligence (AI) was officially introduced in 1956 at the Dartmouth Summer Research Project on Artificial Intelligence. The term "artificial intelligence" was coined at this workshop by John McCarthy, a computer scientist. The workshop was a gathering of computer scientists, including McCarthy, Marvin Minsky, Nathaniel Rochester, and Claude Shannon.
        The term “artificial intelligence” was coined and came into popular use. Dates of note: 1950: Alan Turing published “Computer Machinery and Intelligence” which proposed a test of machine intelligence called The Imitation Game.

    <h3>Here are some other notable events in the history of AI:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>1950:</strong> Alan Turing published Computer Machinery and Intelligence, which proposed a test of machine intelligence called The Imitation Game.
        </li>
        <li><strong>1952:</strong> Arthur Samuel developed a program to play checkers that was the first to learn the game independently.
        </li>
        <li><strong>1970:</strong> Marvin Minsky predicted that a machine with the general intelligence of an average human being would be available in three to eight years.
        </li>
        <li><strong>1977:</strong> IBM's Deep Blue defeated reigning world chess champion Gary Kasparov. 
        </li>
        <li><strong>2000:</strong> The field of AI experienced significant growth with renewed interest.
